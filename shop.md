## Tools

### Table Saw

> I saw what you did there!

#### Materials

Thin wood and acrylic. Upon bypassing the brake cartridge and changing the blade: Thin metal sheets.

#### Usage

We have a SawStopÂ® 10" Contractor Saw. This table saw is useful for cutting acrylic, and thin wood. If you switch the blade to cut metal **make sure you [bypass the emergency brake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4WKuStm_ts)**. Metal and some "wet" or green wood can be conductive enough to set off the saw's brak cartridge. This an expensive mistake that can be avoided.

1. Put on safety goggle, secure any loose hair, sleeves, jackets, or ties. Do not put on gloves.
2. Flip the red switch on the front panel to the on position. This will cause a green light to start blinking.
3. Wait till the green light is solid then line up your material and proceed cutting!

If the red light flashs or the saw stops un expectedly don't worry it's probably not your fault! Just consult the [manual](https://www.sawstop.com/images/uploads/manuals/Manual_CNS.pdf) and an Instructor for help. It's better to deal with a pontential issue then to let something sit and have it be a problem later.

#### Known problems

* If the blade doesn't start reset the braker on the back of the control panel.

#### Important notes

Make use of the tools on the table. Try to provide one path for your material to go (forward into and through the blade). Push material through with a firm hand. The blade is spinning towards you and you don't what the blade to catch on the material and throw it backwards into you.

### Drill Press
