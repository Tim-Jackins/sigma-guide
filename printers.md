# 3D Printers

> Uprint, but not until my part is done.

## Uprint SE Plus / F170 / Ultimaker 2+ / Makerbot

ABS / PLA plastic. Support material.

### Usage

1. Open GrabCAD Print and add your part to the print queue. If your part is next up in the queue, walk over to the printer it is queue up on and start the printing process. **Make sure you queue your parts once and not twice!**

### Known problems

* Sometimes GrabCAD Print *forgets* where the printers are. If the printers show up as `Disconnected` simply copy the IPv4 address (it probably looks something like 10.10.56.17), select `Add` from the printer menu, and paste the IPv4 address that you previously copied. If this doesn't work consult tech help.

## Recycling material

Everytime a new spool is unboxed save the box. Everytime a spool runs out of material box it in a saved box. Once you have three boxed spools follow [these shipping instructions](https://www.stratasys.com/recycling/recycling-instructions#51287761-ffb3-44de-b422-cf2aaa35887d) and recycle those spools!

You should read the shipping instructions but I'll sum up the procedure:

1. Duct Tape the boxes together securely.
2. Use the side menu to generate a shipping label (**Company:** Charlottesville High School, **Address:** 1400 Melbourne Rd
Charlottesville VA 22901, **Spools:** three). 
3. Print out the package label and tape it to top of the duct tape box monstrosity!
